### **GuardianBridge v1.3 "Dispatch"**

This update transforms the SOS system into a true multi-incident command platform, giving administrators, responders, and users the tools they need to manage chaos with clarity.

This release focuses on three core areas: providing peace of mind for those in distress, empowering responders with advanced coordination tools, and giving administrators situational awareness.



#### **1. For You and Your Family: A Personalized Safety Net**

In an emergency, knowing you've been heard and that help is on the way is everything. These features are designed to provide that peace of mind.

- **Immediate Confirmation & Updates:** The moment you send an SOS, the system confirms it has been received. As responders begin to move, you'll get real-time updates with a growing list of names, so you know exactly who is coming to help.
  - *Confirmation:* `ü§ñ Your SOSM has been received. Alerting assigned personnel.`
  - *First Responder:* `ü§ñ Help is on the way. Alice is responding to your alert.`
  - *Second Responder:* `ü§ñ Help is on the way. Alice and Bob are now responding to your alert.`
- **New Profile Fields for Critical Info:** In the Admin Panel, you can now add two new crucial pieces of information to your user profile:
  - **Emergency Point of Contact / Next of Kin:** A dedicated field to store information for responders, such as a spouse's contact info, a neighbor's name, or critical medical notes.
  - **SOS Notify List:** This powerful new field allows you to create a custom notification list. You can add a comma-separated list of **email addresses, node IDs, or GuardianBridge usernames**. When you trigger an SOS, the system will send the full alert not only to the official tagged responders but also to every contact on your personal list, ensuring your family and friends are immediately notified.



#### **2. For Responders: A Conversational Interface for a Crisis**

What happens when you send `RESPONDING` and there are three active emergencies? The gateway will now ask you which one you're heading to.

- **Step 1:** You send `RESPONDING` as a Direct Message to the gateway.

- **Step 2:** The gateway instantly replies with a numbered list of active incidents:

  ```
  Multiple active alerts. Reply with command and number (e.g., ACK 2):
  1. SOSM from Alice
  2. SOSF from David
  ```

- **Step 3:** You commit to a specific incident by replying with the command and number: `RESPONDING 1`.

The system then logs you as responding to Alice's alert, notifies the admin, and updates all other responders. This simple, conversational system makes it easy to coordinate even when the situation is complex.



#### **3. For Administrators: The Incident Command Dashboard**

Your "Live Node List" is no longer just a list; during a crisis, it becomes a true **Incident Command Dashboard**.

When multiple SOS alerts are active, the list automatically reorganizes itself, grouping responders and acknowledgers directly under the specific incident they've committed to. This provides an instant, at-a-glance "order of battle" for the entire situation.

- **SOS Sender 1 (Alice)** - Highlighted in Red
  - *SOS Message: "Need medical assistance for injured dog"*
  - **Bob (Responding)** - Highlighted in Green
  - **Charlie (Acknowledged)** - Highlighted in Yellow
- **SOS Sender 2 (David)** - Highlighted in Red
  - *SOS Message: "Smoke visible from my location"*
- **Other Network Nodes...**

This hierarchical view gives you immediate, critical situational awareness, allowing you to see which incidents are being handled and which still need resources.

### **How to Use the New Features**

I've kept the process simple so anyone can use it‚Äîeven under stress.

- **For Users in Distress:**

  - Ask your administrator to update your user profile with your **"Emergency Point of Contact"** and **"SOS Notify"** information.

  - Send `SOS` with a brief note:

    ```
    SOSF Smoke visible from my location
    ```

  - Look for the confirmation message.

  - Reply `Y` or `YES` if you receive a `[CHECK-IN]` prompt.

- **For Responders:**

  - When you see an alert, send `ACK`. If there are multiple incidents, the gateway will ask you to choose. Reply with `ACK 1`, `ACK 2`, etc.
  - If you‚Äôre heading to the scene, send `RESPONDING`. If prompted, reply with `RESPONDING 1`, `RESPONDING 2`, etc.

- **For Administrators:**

  - The new Incident Command Dashboard is fully automatic. Simply monitor the "Live Node List" on the Status tab during an event.
  - In the **Settings** tab, configure the **SOS Timers & Escalation** to match your community‚Äôs protocols.

### **Moving Forward Together**

With **v1.3 "Dispatch"**, GuardianBridge takes a major step toward building stronger, safer, more connected communities‚Äîeven when the grid goes down. I believe these upgrades will make GuardianBridge an indispensable part of any emergency preparedness plan.

As always, I welcome your feedback, ideas, and contributions.

Stay safe, and stay connected.

### **GuardianBridge v1.2 "Lifeline Lookout": Streamlined Off-Grid Crisis Communication**

When I first started building GuardianBridge, the motivation was personal. After a tornado severed all communication in our community, I saw firsthand the fear and confusion that followed. That experience shaped a simple mission: to create a lifeline that works when everything else fails‚Äîa tool that delivers clarity, safety, and coordination when they‚Äôre needed most.

Today, I‚Äôm excited to introduce the next step in that journey: **GuardianBridge v1.2 "Lifeline Lookout."** This major update transforms our SOS system into a more responsive, semi-automated emergency communication platform built to keep communities connected when it matters most.

------

### **What‚Äôs New: Key Upgrades You Can Count On**

Version 1.2 focuses on three core goals: eliminating uncertainty for people in distress, giving responders better coordination tools, and building safety nets that keep working even when things go wrong.

------

#### **1. For the Person in Distress: Peace of Mind in Seconds**

In an emergency, the scariest moment is wondering if your call for help even got through. Lifeline Lookout removes that uncertainty:

- **Instant Confirmation:**
   The moment you send an SOS, the system alerts your response team *and* sends you an immediate confirmation:

  ```
  ü§ñ Your SOSM has been received. Alerting assigned personnel.
  ```

  Now you know for sure that help is on the way.

- **Multi-Responder Updates:**
   Emergencies often require more than one responder. As each team member sends `RESPONDING`, you see a running list of names:

  - *First responder:* `ü§ñ Help is on the way. Alice is responding to your alert.`
  - *Second responder:* `ü§ñ Help is on the way. Alice and Bob are now responding to your alert.`

- **SOS with Context:**
   A message is good. A message with context saves lives. Add a short note to your SOS‚Äîfor example:

  ```
  SOSM Need medical assistance for injured dog
  ```

  Responders see this first, giving them vital information before they arrive.

------

#### **2. For Responders & Admins: Clear, Coordinated Response**

To prevent confusion and overlap, Lifeline Lookout adds new tools for response teams:

- **Team-Based Response:**
   Multiple responders can now send `RESPONDING`, with each update shared to all team members so everyone knows who‚Äôs on the way.

- **Incident Command Dashboard:**
   In the Admin Panel, the ‚ÄúLive Node List‚Äù now transforms during an SOS:

  - SOS sender: Top of the list, in red
  - Responders: Grouped below, in green
  - Acknowledged-but-not-responding members: Grouped in yellow

  This gives admins a clear, real-time view of the entire situation.

------

#### **3. For System Resilience: Built-In Safety Nets**

Emergencies can escalate quickly. Lifeline Lookout includes features to keep help moving even when things go wrong:

- **Active Check-In (Dead Man‚Äôs Switch):**
   The system periodically pings the person in distress. If there‚Äôs no response after multiple attempts, it automatically escalates the alert with an **UNRESPONSIVE** status for all responders.
- **No-Response Escalation:**
   If no tagged responders acknowledge an alert within a set time, the system automatically rebroadcasts the SOS to the entire network, ensuring no one is left behind.

------

### **Quick Start: How to Use the New Features**

We kept the process simple so anyone can use it‚Äîeven under stress.

- **For Users in Distress:**

  - Send `SOS` with a brief note:

    ```
    SOSF Smoke visible from my location
    ```

  - Look for the confirmation message.

  - Reply `Y` or `YES` if you receive a `[CHECK-IN]` prompt.

- **For Responders:**

  - Send `ACK` when you see an alert.
  - Send `RESPONDING` if you‚Äôre heading to the scene‚Äîeven if others already are.

- **For Administrators:**

  - In the **Settings** tab, configure **SOS Email Notifications** and **Timers & Escalation** to match your community‚Äôs protocols.

------

### **Moving Forward Together**

With **Lifeline Lookout**, GuardianBridge takes a major step toward building stronger, safer, more connected communities‚Äîeven when the grid goes down. I believe these upgrades will make GuardianBridge an indispensable part of any emergency preparedness plan.

As always, I welcome your feedback, ideas, and contributions as we continue building tools that keep people connected when it matters most.
