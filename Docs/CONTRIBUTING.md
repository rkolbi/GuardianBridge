# Contributing to GuardianBridge

First off, thank you for considering contributing to GuardianBridge! We welcome any and all contributions, from simple bug reports to new feature ideas.

### A Note on Current Maintainer Availability

GuardianBridge is currently a passion project maintained by a single developer in their spare time. While all contributions are highly encouraged and deeply appreciated, please be aware that there may be a delay in reviewing and merging pull requests.

This is simply due to time constraints, and any delays are not a reflection of the value of your contribution. Your effort is valued, and your patience is greatly appreciated.

The best way to get started is by **opening** an issue to discuss your proposed **changes or feature ideas first.** This helps ensure we're aligned before you invest significant time in development.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you think you've found a bug, please check the existing [Issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/rkolbi/GuardianBridge/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue.

When reporting a bug, please include as much detail as possible:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.
- Any relevant logs or error messages from `journalctl -u guardianbridge.service`.
- Your operating system (e.g., DietPi, Raspberry Pi OS) and hardware setup.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to start a discussion. This allows us to coordinate efforts and ensure your idea aligns with the project's goals before you spend time on implementation.

### Submitting Code Changes

If you'd like to contribute code to fix a bug or add a new feature, the general workflow is:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `feature/add-new-widget` or `fix/broadcast-bug`).
3. **Make your changes**. Please try to follow the existing code style and add comments where necessary.
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce new problems.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** (PR) back to the `main` branch of the original GuardianBridge repository. Please provide a clear description of the problem you are solving and the changes you have made.

We will review your pull request as soon as possible.

## Code of Conduct

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment, we expect all contributors to adhere to a code of conduct. Please be respectful and considerate in all your interactions on this project. Harassment or exclusionary behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.
